## Hi there

It's good to be back on GitHub! ðŸ‘‹

## Projects

I'm in the middle of a bit of a "life reset" and on the lookout for the next big thing to spend some time on. Please feel free to reach out to me if you have a project you think I should check out. I'm particularly interested in climate change, alternate energy, networking and messaging, electric vehicles (and other clean transportation), conservation, and health. Open an issue on this [repo](https://github.com/badslug/badslug/issues).

## A bit about me

I've been spending most of my professional time coding recently in [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) (esp in [Browser](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API) and [Node](https://nodejs.org)), [Go](https://golang.org), and [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp). I'm a firm believer that technology is a tool to solve problems rather than an end unto itself. I frequently change languages and frameworks to find the best fit so this list changes (often).

It's hard to work in startups and contract work for long without crossing paths with a lot of languages and frameworks. In school I started with C/C++ (Borland C++ Builder and the excellent Watcom compilers). Thankfully I escaped needing to learn Fortran! My next passion was spending over a decade building everything under the sun ðŸ˜‰ in Java (and still have the JavaOne sweatshirts to nerd out over). Big enterprise Java, hardware accelerated Java, JavaCard on SIM cards, servers, embedded, and desktop (Swing baby!). There was work and projects in python, php, ruby and others but it took Go to break my Java addiction. Go is a magical return to the simplicity and power of C without all the friction and a wonderful standard library.

I started out hating JavaScript as a chaotic, untyped, necessary evil; required (but resisted) on the browser. Using it over the years, JavaScript has become something I love. In strange ways, it is a return to the power of C (with the same dangerous flexibility).
